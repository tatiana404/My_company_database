# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). The command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL should be created during this assignment
